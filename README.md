# instagram-content-efficiency-model
Final year project file - Instagram content efficiency model 

## Project Overview
This project develops a data-driven Content Efficiency Model to evaluate social media engagement and identify factors that contribute to high-performing content on Meta platforms (Instagram and Facebook).

## Research Questions
1. What factors significantly influence engagement on social media posts?
2. How can engagement metrics be used to guide content promotion decisions?

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and contains post-level engagement metrics such as likes, comments, saves, sentiment labels, content type, post day, and post time.
